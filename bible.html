                The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee.
                Finding Philip, he said to <br>him, "Follow me."

                Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. 
                 Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote-Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
                
                 "Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?" Nathanael asked.
                
                "Come and see,"" said Philip.</p>
