        <h2>Mudika Big Game 2021</h2>
        <p>1. Are we allowed to use Google?</p>
        <p>Yes! In fact, Google is essential for solving several of the puzzles.</p>
        <br>
        <p>2. What should we do when we finish solving all the puzzles?</p>
        <p>Figure out the 3Ws: who took Valerie, where is she, and why. Then use the call for help Zoom function. Clarissa will come to your room to take final answers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>3. How does my group call for help/get a hint?</p>
        <p>Click on the Call For Help button near the bottom of the Zoom call. Wait for Clarissa to come into your room. Work on other puzzles as you wait.</p>
        <br>
        <p>4. How much time do we have?</p>
        <p>50 minutes</p>
        <br>
        <p>5. How are the winners decided?</p>
        <p>By time. We will keep track of which groups call Clarissa to give their final answers first. Points will also be deducted based on number of hints used.</p>
