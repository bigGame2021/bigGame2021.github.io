        <p>1. Are we allowed to use Google?</p>
        <p>Yes! In fact, Google is essential for solving several of the puzzles.</p>
        <br>
        <p>2. What should we do when we finish solving all the puzzles?</p>
        <p>Figure out the 3Ws: who took Valerie, where is she, and why. Then return to the main Zoom room and give Clarissa your answers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>3. How does my group call for help/get a hint?</p>
        <p>Click on the Call For Help button at the bottom right of the Zoom call. Wait for Clarissa to come into your room. Work on other puzzles as you wait.</p>
