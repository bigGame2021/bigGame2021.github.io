        <h2>2021</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the annual Mudika Big Game...online edition!<br>
         <br>
        Your group will split into two equal groups A and B but your entire group will still be working
        together. <br>
        Here are a few house rules before you start:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No screen sharing in any form is allowed. This includes
                taking pictures of your screen and holding them up to your
                camera for your teammates to see, sending screen shots, etc.
            </li>
            <li>Do not have both windows for Group A and Group B open. If you are in Group A, you should
                only have A's window open. If you are in Group B, you should only have B's window open.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
