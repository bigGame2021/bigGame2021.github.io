        <h2>2021</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the annual Mudika Big Game...online edition!<br>
         <br>
        Here are a few house rules before you start:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No screen sharing in any form is allowed. This includes
                taking pictures of your screen and holding them up to your
                camera for your teammates to see
            </li>
            <li>For any techny participants here, please note that viewing the source 
                page will be futile as the source code has been obfuscated to
                prevent cheating(and it ruins the fun :) )
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When your entire team is ready, everybody may click start to begin the game.
            Work together with your teammates to solve the puzzles and have fun!
        </p>
