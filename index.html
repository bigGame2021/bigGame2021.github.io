        <h1>Mudika's Big Game!</h1>
        <h2>2021</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the annual Mudika Big Game, online edition!</p> 
        <p>The gamemaster, Valerie Wirianto, has created a Catholic-themed escape room with lots of puzzles for you to solve. Your team splits into two groups, A and B.
            You have until 5:10 to escape. You may use Google. When your group is finished, use the call for help Zoom function and Clarissa will come take your answers. 
            Teams with least number of hints/final answser guesses wins. Ties are broken by which team gives the correct final answers first.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>You enter the rooms which she assigned you, only for you to notice that she has disappeared!
            Your new objective is to safely escape and find out who took Valerie, where she is, and why she was taken.</p>
       <br>
            <p>Here are a few house rules before you start:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No screen sharing in any form is allowed. This includes taking pictures of your screen and holding them up to your camera for your teammates to see, sending screen shots, etc.
            </li>
            <li>Do not have both windows for Group A and Group B open. If you are in Group A, you should only have A's window open. If you are in Group B, you should only have B's window open.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When your entire team is ready, everybody may click their associated links below to start. Work together with your teammates to solve the puzzles and save the Mudika 2021 Retreat!
