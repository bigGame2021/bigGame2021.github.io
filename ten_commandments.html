        <p class="dialogue">
        1) I am the Lord thy God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of
        bondage. Thou shalt not have strange gods before Me. Thou shalt not make to yourself a
        graven thing, not the likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, nor of
        those things that are in the waters under the earth. Thou shalt not adore them nor serve them.<br>
        2) Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. <br>
        3) Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day.<br>
        4) Honor thy father and thy mother.<br>
        5) Thou shalt not kill.<br>
        6) Thou shalt not commit adultery.<br>
        7) Thou shalt not steal.<br>
        8) Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.<br>
        9) Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.<br>
        10) Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods.<br>
